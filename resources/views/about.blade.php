                    Welcome to FTI Untar Retrieval Key, a solution developed by FTI Untar students to revolutionize the key lending system within our institution. In response to the persistent challenges posed by the traditional paper-based key retrieval system, we recognized the need for a modern, efficient, and error-free solution. Our website aims to address these challenges by providing a centralized platform for managing schedules, key lending, class information, and more.
